# Function to generate fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n):
  a = 0
  b = 1
  fib_list = []
  for i in range(n):
    fib_list.append(a)
    c = a + b
    a = b
    b = c
  return fib_list

# Print first 20 fibonacci numbers in a single line
print(*fibonacci(20), sep=", ")

## This script uses a function to generate the fibonacci sequence and then prints out the first 20 numbers in the sequence in a single line, separated by commas. The * before the fibonacci(20) is used to unpack the list and the sep=", " argument in the print function separates the numbers with a comma and a space.
